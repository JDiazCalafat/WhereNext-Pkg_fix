Title: Biological Survey Recommending System Based on General Dissimilarity Modeling 
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Jorge Vel치squez-Tibat치
Maintainer: Jorge Vel치squez-Tibat치 <jorge.velasquez@tnc.org>
Description: WhereNext is a recommendation system to identify iteratively sites that complement the most existing biodiversity surveys. 
    WhereNext will guide you through the process of developing a General Dissimilarity Model (GDM) for your group and area of interest 
    based on occurrence data as well as identifying iteratively survey sites that maximize your potential to record new species.
